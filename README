README for GW+cumulant theory code:

The code is written in octave and can be run via
octave gwc.m

The input file is gwc_inp.m.  

The input data (=the freq grid and self energy from a GW calculation )
should be provided in a file called sigma.dat, where the 1st column
contains the freq grid, the 2nd column the real part of the self
energy and the 3rd column the imaginary part. 

An example input file (with a corresponding sigma.dat) file for a
three-dimenesional jellium calculation is provided.

The output is contained in the file gwc_output, where the 1st column
is the freq grid and the 2nd column is the GW+cumulant spectral
function.

All energies are in eV.
